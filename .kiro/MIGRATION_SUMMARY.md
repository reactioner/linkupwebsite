# Cursor to Kiro Migration Summary

## Migration Completed ✅

Successfully migrated the LinkUp Dating App project from Cursor to Kiro-friendly configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Kiro Configuration Structure
- **`.kiro/settings/mcp.json`** - Migrated MCP server configuration from `.cursor/mcp.json`
- **`.kiro/steering/`** - Created project guidance files for automatic context

### 2. Steering Files Created
- **`linkup-project-context.md`** - Always included project overview and technical requirements
- **`development-standards.md`** - Code quality and security standards (triggered by code files)
- **`phase-2-requirements.md`** - Manual inclusion for current development phase

### 3. Project Documentation
- **`README.md`** - Comprehensive project documentation with Kiro-specific guidance
- **`.kiro/MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md`** - This migration summary

## Kiro-Specific Features Enabled

### Automatic Context
- Project overview and technical requirements automatically included
- Development standards applied when working with code files
- Phase-specific requirements available via `#phase-2-requirements`

### MCP Integration
- Task Master AI server configured for project management
- Environment variables template provided for API keys
- Auto-approval settings available for trusted operations

### Development Workflow
- Clear phase-based development structure
- Comprehensive technical documentation
- Security and quality standards enforcement

## Next Steps

1. **Configure API Keys** - Update `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` with actual API keys
2. **Phase 2 Development** - Use `#phase-2-requirements` for current development focus
3. **Code Development** - Leverage automatic steering for consistent code quality

## Files to Remove (Optional)
The following Cursor-specific files can be safely removed:
- `.cursor/` directory (migrated to `.kiro/settings/`)
- `.taskmaster/` directory (functionality replaced by MCP integration)

## Kiro Usage Tips
- Use `#linkup-project-context` for automatic project guidance
- Use `#phase-2-requirements` when working on current development phase
- Development standards automatically apply when editing code files
- MCP servers provide enhanced project management capabilities

**Migration Status: ✅ COMPLETE**
The LinkUp project is now fully Kiro-optimized and ready for Phase 2 development.
