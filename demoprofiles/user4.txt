Final Profile: Ke Xin Chong
Ke Xin
Looking for a partner in crime for both global adventures and finding the best local food truck.

I'm a strategist by nature. I love looking at the big picture and figuring out how all the pieces fit together to create something great. This drive led me from my time at Stanford into the world of finance and now to a startup where I get to help shape a vision and bring it to life. I thrive on that energy and sense of purpose.

But life is all about balance. For me, that means channeling that same energy into exploring the world. I am passionate about traveling and believe the best way to understand a place is through its food. I'm on a perpetual quest for the most amazing meals, whether that's at a Michelin-starred restaurant or a hidden street food stall. My friends would tell you I'm the one who always has a plan for our next adventure.

You'll usually find me:

Scouring travel blogs for my next destination.

Trying a new recipe that's probably a little too ambitious for a weeknight.

Enjoying a glass of wine and a great conversation with friends.

I'm looking for...

Someone who is driven, thoughtful, and has a true zest for life. A partner who is ambitious in their own right but knows how to unplug and enjoy the moment. If your passport is one of your most prized possessions and you're always up for trying something new, I'd love to hear from you.
