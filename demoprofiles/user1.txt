Final Profile: Rachandeep Kaur

Building cool things with great people. Also, perfecting my chai recipe.

I'm one of those people who genuinely loves what they do. For me, that's getting together with a smart, passionate team and figuring out how to build something new from the ground up. My day job is in the world of AI, which is really just a fancy way of saying I solve puzzles for a living. I love the creativity in it and the challenge of starting with a blank canvas. There's nothing more rewarding than that "aha!" moment when everything clicks.

My journey has taken me from my time at Stanford to working at places like Google, but the most important thing I've learned is that the people you surround yourself with make all the difference.

When I'm not untangling a technical problem, you can find me:

Experimenting with new spices for my homemade chai (I'm on a mission to find the perfect blend).

Exploring a new hiking trail, preferably one with a great view at the end.

Getting lost in a good book, or getting overly competitive on board game night.

I'm looking for...

Someone who is kind, curious, and passionate about somethingâ€”whether it's their work, a hobby, or a cause. If you're a great conversationalist who believes that the best partnerships are built on teamwork and mutual support (and you're open to being my chai taste-tester), let's connect.
