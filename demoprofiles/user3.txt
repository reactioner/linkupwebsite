Final Profile: Alexander Permut
Alex
My ideal plus-one for a deep dive down a Wikipedia rabbit hole... or a ski slope.

I've always been driven by a deep sense of curiosity. It's what led me through a PhD at MIT, where I basically got to spend my days asking "what if?" and chasing the answers. Eventually, one of those questions got so interesting that I decided to take the leap and build a company around it, which has been an incredible adventure in itself.

While I love the intellectual challenge of my work, I'm a firm believer in balancing screen time with summit time. I'm happiest when I'm outdoors, whether that's carving down a ski slope, finding a new hiking path, or just exploring a new neighborhood. I love to travel and experience the world in a hands-on way.

I thrive on deep, intellectual conversationsâ€”the kind where you lose track of time. I'm looking for someone who is passionate, thoughtful, and has a curiosity of their own about the world.

Let's talk if:

You believe a good debate is a form of entertainment.

Your travel style involves a mix of planning and spontaneous discovery.

You're not afraid of a little friendly competition, on the slopes or at the board game table.

I'm looking for...

A partner in curiosity. Someone who is excited to learn and grow together, to share adventures both big and small, and to build something meaningful. If you're up for exploring both ideas and mountains, let's connect.
