Final Profile: King T.
King
By day, I build products at Google. By night, I tell stories through a camera lens.

I've always been fascinated by the power of a good story. That curiosity has led me down two parallel paths that I love. At Google, I get to figure out the story of a productâ€”how it can help people and fit into their lives. It's a world of logic, empathy, and creative problem-solving.

My other passion is telling stories visually through film and photography. There's a certain magic in capturing a moment or an emotion and sharing it with others. It's my creative outlet and has been an incredibly rewarding journey (some of my work has even been featured in a few publications!). For me, the two worlds aren't that different; both are about understanding people and connecting with them.

When I'm not working or behind a camera, you might find me:

Exploring a new part of the city, looking for interesting shots.

In a movie theater, probably over-analyzing the cinematography.

Catching up with friends over a good meal.

I'm looking for...

A partner with a creative spirit and a curious mind. Someone who is passionate about their own path and appreciates the beauty in everyday moments. If you have a story you'd love to share, I'm all ears.
