Final Profile: Anant Dwivedi
Anant
Equally passionate about scaling a startup and a mountain. Let's explore both.

I'm a builder at heart. I get a huge amount of energy from turning an idea into something real that people can use, which is what I get to do every day as a founder. The journey of building a company from scratch is a wild ride, and I love every part of it.

That same drive for exploration extends to my life outside of work. I'm an avid traveler, and my passion for it was supercharged during my MBA at Stanford, where I met people from every corner of the globe. Growing up in India and now living in the US has given me a deep appreciation for diverse backgrounds and perspectives. I'm always looking to learn something new, whether it's from a book, a conversation, or a trip to a place I've never been.

On a typical weekend, I might be:

Planning my next international trip (or a spontaneous weekend getaway).

Trying to find the most authentic global cuisine in the city.

Catching up with friends, probably debating the future of tech or the best travel hacks.

I'm looking for...

Someone with a curious mind, an adventurous spirit, and a kind heart. A partner who is passionate about their own journey but is excited to build a new one together. If you're up for exploring new cultures, new foods, and new ideas, I'd love to start a conversation. What's the next destination on your list?
